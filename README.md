Akin to Abraham Lincoln’s words of wisdom, the experience of a busy parent of multiple children is elevated by preparation: When a parent smoothly plans their children’s extracurriculars, they facilitate a better experience for both themself and their children during the event.  

Famtivity is an Android smartphone application that is intended for parents and administrators of extracurriculars.  

#### Profiles  

A parent or administrator creates a profile. There is no distinction between the two during profile creation. The distinction between parent and administrator comes into play when the user chooses to perform actions in parent mode or administrator mode.  

Each user may create several child profiles within their profile. The children do not create their own profiles, because the application is intended for children who are not yet at the age at which they would manage their own profiles and extracurriculars.  

#### Modes  

The user may switch between parent mode and administrator mode.  

#### Calendars  

When acting as an administrator, the user can create a calendar for a particular extracurricular. For example, the user may create a calendar for the seventh grade chess club’s autumn term. The application generates a unique identifier for this calendar, which they share with parents.  

Upon receiving the identifier, the parent searches the identifier in the application. The result is the desired extracurricular calendar.  

#### Child Subscriptions

After finding the desired extracurricular calendar, the parent selects that they would like to subscribe a child to that calendar. The application prompts the parent to select which child they would like to subscribe. The parent can then view that extracurricular calendar in their child’s profile.
